# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem definition (Client identification)
My client owns a badminton racket company and plans to upgrade his store-running experience and his clients' shopping experience while shopping online. Since they have never had a preexisting online website they have faced **some consequences**: 

* Disorganized financial departments, do not have space to keep track of the economic transactions of their shop, thus using primitive functions, more effort, work hours, unsafe, and unorganized.
* Having problems overseeing the inventory of materials left for production, thus leading to future budget proposition problems
* Having problems seeing history records of orders, what they have ordered - materials and costs to better plan for future
* Concerns about company security breaches, someone unauthorized logging in
* Issue tackled: "As the factory grew and the owner required help from his coworkers, it was tough to figure out who was on factory grounds and who was not.
* A need to find an easier alternative to buy or make materials needed for the production as it takes too long and is too complicated to go to another side
(see evidence of consultation in Appendix A) 

## Design statement 

I plan to develop a system for a Badminton racket company using Python, Kivymd, and SQLite. This will provide a thought-out solution that would counter the challenges faced by the company CEO in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of inventory storage, money tracking, and additional functions of the application that allows login, searching by filter, company, founder, and material description. This solution will provide a reliable and user-friendly tool to the Badminton company and its customers to manage and track all records of operations executed on the application as well as interface upgrades to ensure the program runs smoothly and effectively.

  ## Proposed solution
  
- general solution - "GUI" that is connected to the database
justification of tolls - python, SQLite, kivy

  **Design statement**

  ## Sucess criteria
1. The application offers a feature to track money (tracking meaning that these transactions would be registered and safely saved in a database): orders, purchases [**Issue tackled: "Disorganized financial departments, do not have space to keep track of the economic transactions of their shop, thus using primitive functions, more effort, work hours, unsafe, and unorganized."**]
2. The application offers a feature to keep track of inventory (keeping track meaning that it is saved on a database and displayed to the owner on a separate GUI screen) [**Issue tackled: "Having problems overseeing the inventory of materials left for production, thus leading to future budget proposition problems"**]
3. The application offers a machine that allows the user to create an item, thus altering the inventory [Issue tackled: "A need to find an easier alternative to buy or make materials needed for the production as it takes too long and is too complicated to go to another side"]
4. The application offers a login page - register new accounts, and existing accounts [**Issue tackled: "Concerns about company security breaches, someone unauthorized logging in"**] 
5. The application offers an overview of the workers on the factory ground displaying ID, name, description, status, and location [**Issue tackled: "As the factory grew and the owner required help from his coworkers, it was tough to figure out who is on factory grounds and who is not."**]
6. The application offers a feature to filter customer orders of the shop based on name and or ID, displaying materials and budget used [**Issue tackled: "Having problems seeing history records of orders, what they have ordered - materials and costs to better plan for future"**]
