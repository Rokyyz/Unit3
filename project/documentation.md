# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition (Client identification)
My client is the owner of a badminton racket company who plans to upgrade his store-running experience and his clients' shopping experience while shopping online. Since they have never had a preexisting online website they have faced some consequences: 
 
* Having problems overseeing the inventory of materials left for production, thus leading to future budget proposition problems
* Clients complaining about the lack of information that they have regarding materials used
* Clients are confused about what they can afford
* Concerns about company security breaches
* Complaints from clients wanting to know more about the company and its owner
(see evidence of consultation in Appendix A)
  
The platform requires:
* Track money: orders, purchases
* Track of inventory, live update if decreases or increases
* Machine to make the item/buy materials
* Company and founder description, and material description
* A login page - register, and existing users, encrypted password
* Page for clients to see what they can afford based on their budget (also provides materials)


- who the client is
- what is the issue
- consequences of not having software
- any existing solution
 

  ## Proposed solution

- general solution - "GUI" that is connected to the database
justification of tolls - python, SQLite, kivy
