# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition (Client identification)
My client is the owner of a badminton racket company who plans to upgrade his store-running experience and his clients' shopping experience while shopping online. Since they have never had a preexisting online website they have faced some consequences: 
 
* Having problems overseeing the inventory of materials left for production, thus leading to future budget proposition problems
* Clients complaining about the lack of information that they have regarding materials used
* Clients are confused about what they can afford
* Concerns about company security breaches
* Complaints from clients wanting to know more about the company and its owner
