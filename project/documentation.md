## Problem definition (Client identification)
My client owns a badminton racket company and plans to upgrade his store-running experience and his clients' shopping experience while shopping online. Since they have never had a preexisting online website they have faced **some consequences**: 
 
* Having problems overseeing the inventory of materials left for production, thus leading to future budget proposition problems
* Clients complaining about the lack of information that they have regarding materials used
* Clients are confused about what they can afford
* Concerns about company security breaches
* Complaints from clients wanting to know more about the company and its owner
(see evidence of consultation in Appendix A) 

## Design statement 

I plan to develop a system for a Badminton racket company using Python, Kivymd, and SQLite. This will provide a thought-out solution that would counter the challenges faced by the company CEO in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of inventory storage, money tracking, and additional functions of the application that allows login, searching by filter, company, founder, and material description. This solution will provide a reliable and user-friendly tool to the Badminton company and its customers to manage and track all records of operations executed on the application as well as interface upgrades to ensure the program runs smoothly and effectively.

  ## Proposed solution
  
- general solution - "GUI" that is connected to the database
justification of tolls - python, SQLite, kivy

  **Design statement**

  ## Sucess criteria
1. The application offers a feature to track money: orders, purchases
2. The application offers a feature to keep track of inventory, and live update if it decreases or increases
3. The application offers a machine to make the item/buy materials
4. The application offers a login page - register, existing accounts, encrypted password
5. The application offers a company and founder bio and material description
6. The application offers a feature to filter customer searches on the online shop based on budget and materials
